    "\n",
    "1. We maintain a population (i.e., a list of seeds) that we use for mutation. Each seed in the population will be an input that provide additional coverage information.\n",
    "2. We will take a seed from the population and fuzz the seed to test the program. If the population is empty, we mutate an initial seed that we provide manually.\n",
    "3. We take the seed from the population semi-randomly, but the seeds that provided more additional coverage have a higher chance of being selected.\n",
    "4. If the new input increased the coverage, we add this new input to the population as a new seed. We assign a score to the seed (i.e., how much coverage it improved).\n",
    "5. We repeat and go back to Step 2 until we execute the fuzzer 100 times (i.e., your pre-defined number of trials).\n",

    "\n",
    "+ IP version 4 has 32 bits. It is divided into 4 octets, where each octet consists of 8 bits. To make life easier for humans, these bits are converted into decimals. The bits can either be 0 or 1. So in an octet, it can start with 00000000 or 11111111 which when converted into decimals can be 0 or 255 respectively. The subnet mask helps us to identify the network of an IP. The subnet mask or the IP address cannot exceed 255 in one octet. IP version 4 has 5 classes and based on the classes, it's subnet mask is decided. This particular way of giving subnet mask is called FLSM (Fixed length subnet mask). \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Class A- 255.0.0.0\n",
    "    - Class B- 255.255.0.0\n",
    "    - Class C- 255.255.255.0\n",
    "\n",
    "+ We also have VLSM (Variable length subnet mask). It was introduced to reduce the wasteage of IP. The decimal numbers 128, 192, 224, 240, 248, 252 and 254 are also valid if and only if it's previous octet is 255 and it's next octets/octet is 0. Thus the total number of inputs is 256^4 since it is 32 bits, which is approximately 4.9 Billion and the valid input is just 28. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ When we use random fuzzing method, we should have higher computation power to try 4.9 Billion trials and system will give output only for 28 trials. \n",
    "    \n",
    "## Random Fuzzer Approach 1\n",
    "\n",
    "+ When it comes to randomization, in our 1st approach we are going to randomize numbers in all 4 octets. We are planning to 1000 trials. In this case, the chance of getting a valid subnet mask is extremely low. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Random Fuzzer Approach 2\n",
    "\n",
    "+ We are going to do 1000 trials. So, instead of randomizing all the 4 octets we are going to first fix the 3rd and 4th octet as 0 and we are going to randomize only the 1st and 2nd octet. Thus, we will get atleast one desired output in 256 runs which is the maximum. \n",
    "+ Similarly we do it for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th octet. By this method, we can atleast have 1 desired output."
